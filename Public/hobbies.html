    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>

    <p>"In my spare time, I love contributing to open-source projects. It's a great way for me to stay up-to-date with the latest technologies while giving back to the developer community. Playing the guitar is another passion of mine—I find it incredibly relaxing and a perfect way to unwind after a long day of coding. I also enjoy traveling and exploring new cultures whenever I get the chance. It’s fascinating to see how people live around the world, and I often bring my camera along to capture the moments. These experiences not only recharge me but also inspire my approach to problem-solving in my professional work."</p>
